            Gulf War Veteran
          </h2>
          <p class="text-navy/80 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            I served in the Gulf War in 1991. My experiences in combat shaped my understanding
            of the value of peace and the importance of every human life.

            The Sailboat Years
          </h2>
          <p class="text-navy/80 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            For most of the last decade, I lived on a sailboat along the northwest gulf coast
            of Florida. In that time, I photographed over 2,000 sunsets in the same sacred space.
            Those quiet moments between day and night taught me the greatest lesson: Life is simple,
            love everyone and start with you.

            Family Court Reform Advocate
          </h2>
          <p class="text-navy/80 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            After six years of experiencing parental alienation and fighting through a family
            court system that failed to protect the parent-child relationship, I became a
            passionate advocate for reform. I work to help other veterans with PTSD, fathers
            facing parental alienation, and families destroyed by family courts.

            Civic Educator & Attorney
          </h2>
          <p class="text-navy/80 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            As an attorney and civic educator, I focus on teaching liberty principles to families.
            I believe that understanding our constitutional rights and the principles of freedom
            is essential for building strong families and communities.

            The Love Everyone Message
          </h2>
          <p class="text-navy/80 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            My core message is simple but profound: We could all live in peace on this earth
            if each of us simply made peace with every person we know. If we each decided to
            love everyone, it would be game over - love wins.
